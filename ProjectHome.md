Welcome to the online home of the fully functional Flyte engine! Flyte aims to be a lightweight, intuitive, and simple platform game engine that dispenses with everything you don't want to deal with to build a game. It is highly integratable with the Flash IDE and can be used with Flex/Flash Builder as well. There is no documentation yet, but here's a rundown of what Flyte includes:

- Automatic setup, keyboard event handling, and level loading
- Simple yet extensible Tile and Terrain elements
- Bodies with gravity, collision, and jumping capabilities
- Extensible and versatile "cog" system lets you build modular classes -- inheritance isn't quite so important
- Built-in animation management
